# onepage-sheduler-for-online-edu
This is primitive css/html file perfoming sheduling of kid's online lessons after manual data filling.
For sure, you shouldn't waste a time with it, but in some cases it can be useful.
It has some level of interactivity with css tricks.
It has not any active things like js.
All will be fine.
